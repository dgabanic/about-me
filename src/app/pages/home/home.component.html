      <h1>Welcome!</h1>

      <h3>My name is David Gabanic, and I am a software engineer based out of Cleveland, OH.</h3>
      <br>
      <ul>
        I graduated from the University of Cincinnati in 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. 
        Since then I have obtained full stack experience with multiple enterprise-level applications in both legacy codebases and modern cloud stacks.
        I have also earned multiple AWS Certifications.
      </ul>

      <ul>
        Have a look around! I wanted to make this site to show my professional experiece and accomplishments, but also to give an insight into who I am as a person.
      </ul>
